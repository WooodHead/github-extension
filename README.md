# Feature

## Create a pull request

when you push a new branch to a repository, you will see this in blew:

![create pull request](./readme/create_pull_request.png)

Then you may click "Compare & pull request" button, and locate to that page:

![create pull request-before](./readme/create_pull_request_before.png)

That's Cool. But only cool when you really wanna merge your branch to master. If you have a branch, maybe we can call it "staging", and you use it as a develop & test branch -- so "master" branch is your production branch.

Your current branch is created from "staging" branch. Besides, it has soooooo many difference with master branch. So then you click "Compare & pull request" button, will it be cool now? NOT AT ALL!!! To many files to compare, sooooo many times have to spend until this page is loaded and after that, you can change the base branch to compare again, correctly.

With this chrome extension, after click "Compare & pull request" button, you'll locate to a page which will only compare a base branch with compare branch itself.
